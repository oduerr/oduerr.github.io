## Using Community Structure for Complex Network Layout


We present a new layout algorithm for complex networks that combines a
multi-scale approach for community detection with a standard force-directed
design. Since community detection is computationally cheap, we can exploit the
multi-scale approach to generate network configurations with close-to-minimal
energy very fast. As a further asset, we can use the knowledge of the community
structure to facilitate the interpretation of large networks, for example the
network defined by protein-protein interactions.

Below you find a video showing the algorithm at work, disentangling the network of streets in the UK, having 4824 vertices and 6827 nodes.

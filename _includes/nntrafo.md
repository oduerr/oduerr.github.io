## Neural Transformation Models
A valuable way to describe a probability distribution is by considering it as a transformation from a basic distribution to a more intricate one. Collaborating with Beate Sick and other colleagues, we employ networks to manage the transformation parameters. This concept can be implemented in various ways.

* To create a versatile output distribution for a neural network (NN):
    * [For instance, modeling age based on an image](link_to_paper)
    * To characterize the [power consumption forecasted by a neural network](link_to_paper)

* For comprehensible integration of NN and straightforward coefficients

## Pi-Vision (Deep Learning on a Raspberry Pi)
The pi-Vision project was my first research project applying *deep learning*. The task was to use a raspberry pi minicomputer for face recognition. We used among other approaches a convolution neural network, a recently developed technique revolutionising image recognition. The following video (please turn off the sound!) shows the trained network doing predictions.
